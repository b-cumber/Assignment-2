## HW2: Use Cases and Use Case Diagrams
This assignment is due Monday, 16 September 2013.

Please see the `usecases.tex` file for a basic template to use for the use cases
themselves.

Please see the `fitg-usecases-missions.tex` file for the Missions Use Cases (completed by @cawaltrip) as a specific example of a use case for *Freedom in the Galaxy*.

If you are not comfortable with Git or with LaTeX then just fill
out the information in plain text and paste it into the issue page for the
use case(s) that you are working on and we will make sure someone adds it to
the document.
