## HW2: Use Cases and Use Case Diagrams
This assignment is due Monday, 16 September 2013.

Please see the `.tex` file for a basic template to use for the use cases
themselves.  If you are not comfortable with Git or with LaTeX then just fill
out the information in plain text and paste it into the issue page for the
use case(s) that you are working on and we will make sure someone adds it to
the document.
